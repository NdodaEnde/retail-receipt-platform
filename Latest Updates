## Current Flow

### Customer Side ✅
1. **Buy from shop** → Get physical receipt
2. **Take photo** → Send via WhatsApp
3. **Receive confirmation** → Platform confirms details + daily draw reminder
4. **Automatic entry** → Into nightly prize draw

This is clean and frictionless. The customer doesn't need to download an app or create an account - WhatsApp is their interface.

### Platform Side ✅

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Receipt image storage | ✅ | Original photo preserved |
| OCR data extraction | ✅ | Shop, items, prices, totals |
| Shop geolocation | ✅ | We extract shop name/address from receipt text, we using Google Maps API to geocoding it to lat/long coordinates |
| Customer upload location | ✅ | We capture lat/long when they share location via WhatsApp |
| Fraud detection | ✅ | Distance-based (when both locations available) |
| Admin receipt viewing | ✅ | Images + extracted data |

### Your Assumptions - Let Me Clarify:

**"Location on receipt will enable us to geo-locate the shop"**
- Currently: We extract the **text address** from the receipt (e.g., "Cnr William Dabbs & Old Paarl Rd, Brackenfell")
- Missing: We need to **geocode** this address → convert it to lat/long coordinates
- Solution: Integrate a geocoding API (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or a SA-specific service)

**"Geo-locate when client uploads"**
- This requires the customer to **share their WhatsApp location** along with the receipt
- Currently: We prompt for location but it's optional
- Enhancement: We could make location sharing mandatory or use cell tower/IP approximation

   - "Upload from 3 different shops this week = 5x entries"

9. **Referral Program**

## Immediate Priority Recommendations

If I were to prioritize what to build next:

1. **🔴 P0: Shop Geocoding** - Convert extracted addresses to coordinates (enables fraud detection properly)

2. **🟡 P1: Analytics Dashboard** - Show shop performance, customer patterns, item popularity

3. **🟢 P2: Customer Receipt History** - Let customers request their receipt history via WhatsApp ("Send HISTORY to get your last 10 receipts")

4. **🔴 P0: Receipt Data Extracted** - should include, timestamp. uploaded date should be the same as that on the receipt timestamp. Admin should see the copy of 
            receipt under the profile of customers.meaning, under the profile name of X, you have a history of purchases, when you click on that receipt, you should be able to 
            see the receipt and line items bought. This is only visible under fraud component, where they have a view buttom.
